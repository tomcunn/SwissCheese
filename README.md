#Inputs
The input into the system will always be the length of the cord regardless of what control method is used. 

# Goals
The goal is to solve this a couple of ways:

* Manually by controlling the cords
* Using motors to run the inverse kinematics to allow control of x,y via a joystick
* AI algorithm that controls the lengths of the cords
* AI algorithm that controls the x,y position, and then computes the lengths of cords
